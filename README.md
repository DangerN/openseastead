# :ocean: Open Seastead :ocean:
A repo to house open source seastead technology.
## Overview
If you are unfamiliar with the concept of seasteading a great place to start is at the [Seasteading Intitute](https://www.seasteading.org/).

The open seastead is designed with modularity as a guiding principal. It will combine both steel and concrete to create a hexagonal lattice of modules. Modules can be broken down into three main parts.

1. Spar - The main hull. A long tube standing vertically supporting the seastead.
2. Reef - Concrete ballast. Attached to the outside to keep the seastead upright as well as provide habitat space for marine life.
3. Topside - Sits atop the spar.
4. Thruster Ring - Electric thrusters are built into a ring encircling the spar. The ring can be raised out of the water for service or during extended periods of disuse.
5. Spine - Semi-flexible structure to bridge seastead modules. Constructed of concrete segments tensioned by wire rope. Water/data/power connections could be enabled.
## Launch Plan
Launching this seastead will be a multistage process. Each part can be obtained gradually over time. The seastead is useful as soon as stage one is complete.
### Stage One - Spar
The first piece to constuct is the spar. Without the reef(ballast) the spar will lay horizontaly on the water and have the rough dimensions of a large yacht. After completion it can be towed to a livaboard slip where the owner can reside while fitting the internals of the spar. A small floating platform may be desired to assist boarding.
### Stage Two - Thrusters
### Stage Three - Reef
The reef consists of a series of concrete slabs to ballast the spar and provide marine habitat. Once stage one has been completed, the spar can be towed to an anchorage where ballasting will begin. The pieces of the reef will need to be floated out to the spar. While the reef is being attached the spar will need to be gradually floated to compensate for the ballast. Once the reef is fully installed the spar can be allowed to float upright. The interal facilities should now be fully operational.
### Stage Four - Topside
### Stage Five - Spine
Up to six spines may be connected to each seastead module. The spines bind each module together as well as provide the seastead with a sturdy hexagonal structure. The spines a semi-rigid but will flex considerably in extreme weather.
