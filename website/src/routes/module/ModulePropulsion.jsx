                    Each module is self propelled.
                    This allows a module to station keep in deep water as well as travel across the seas.

                    Like a school of fish, multiple connected modules move as one.

                <Typography paragraph>
                    The propulsion unit consists of three ducted rim driven electric thrusters.
                    Thrusters are arranged to provide thrust at 60Â° angles from one another.
                    The cluster is located in the center of the module.
                    There are several advantages to this arrangement.

                <Typography variant={'h5'}>Safety</Typography>
                <Typography paragraph>
                    By concealing the propeller blades within the hull the possibility of a prop strike on divers or marine mammals is eliminated.
                </Typography>
                <Typography variant={'h5'}>Reliability</Typography>
                <Typography paragraph>
                    Rim driven thrusters are much more resistant to fouling then their hub driven counterparts as there is no central axle for debris to get wrapped around.
                    Additionally, an electric rim driven thruster has only a single moving part: the propeller itself.
                </Typography>
                <Typography variant={'h5'}>Maintenance</Typography>
                <Typography paragraph>
                    When it comes time to repair or replace a thruster, the ducts can be closed with a gate value and drained.
                    Thrusters can then be serviced while at sea.

                    The preferred method of long range travel utilizes ocean currents.
                    A seastead can travel great distances using relatively little energy.
